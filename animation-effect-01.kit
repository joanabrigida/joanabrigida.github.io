            <p>In our example below, each of our elements are in their own frame. We have a status bar at the top and a navigation menu at the bottom. We also have a card that includes the details of our Upcoming Tickets. Using one of our device presets, we can create a top-level frame for our elements. We can add our elements to the top-level frame to build a single screen in our mobile app.</p>
